## üõ† Technical Stack

### Frameworks & Technologies
- **Swift** - Primary programming language
- **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI
- **UIKit** - Traditional UI components
- **ARKit** - Augmented reality foundation
- **RealityKit** - High-performance 3D rendering
- **SceneKit** - 3D graphics and animation
- **Combine** - Reactive programming
- **SwiftData** - Local data persistence
- **AWS SDK for iOS** - Cloud integration

### Architecture
The application follows Clean Architecture principles:
- **Domain Layer** - Business logic and entities
- **Data Layer** - Repository implementations and data sources
- **Presentation Layer** - ViewModels and Views
- **Use Cases** - Application-specific business rules

### Key Design Patterns
- **MVVM** - Model-View-ViewModel for UI management
- **Repository Pattern** - Abstraction for data access
- **Coordinator Pattern** - Navigation flow management
- **Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling between components

## üì± Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- iPhone or iPad with A12 Bionic chip or later
- Device with LiDAR scanner (for scanning features)
- ARKit compatible device

## üîß Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ARViewUIKit.git
```

2. Open `ARViewUIKit.xcodeproj` in Xcode

3. Add dependencies using Swift Package Manager (SPM):
   - In Xcode, go to File > Add Packages
   - Add required packages:
     - AWS SDK for iOS
     - Any other required dependencies

4. Configure AWS credentials
   - Add your AWS configuration file
   - Set up necessary environment variables

5. Configure signing and capabilities in Xcode

6. Build and run on a physical device (AR features require actual hardware)

## üìù Usage

### AR Visualization
1. Launch the app
2. Tap the "ARView" button
3. Allow camera access
4. Use the focus square to place 3D objects
5. Interact with placed objects using gestures

### Model Interaction
1. Load USDZ models from local storage or remote source
2. Use multi-touch gestures to manipulate models
3. Place models in real-world space
4. Capture photos or record videos of the AR experience

### Documentation
1. Access PDF files from device storage
2. View technical documentation
3. Share documentation with team members

### Machine Scanning (Coming Soon)
1. Access the scanning interface
2. Use LiDAR scanner to capture machine data
